## About / Synopsis

* 'Knowledge is like a garden, without it being cultivated, it cannot be harvested.' Here at Quizlr we believe students and teachers should be given free resources to practice their knowledge. Accessibility is one of our primary goals. That's why you won't see any ads or will be required to pay premium to use our features. Unlimited sets, unlimited cards, unlimited access. For without cultivation, how can we grow?
